# Pet-Stat-Level-Up-Calculator-ITRTG
Calculator for how much stat points your pet will have at a certain level based on current growth. 

THIS ONLY WORKS UP TO LEVEL 99 PET 
STATS DUE TO THE WAY THAT STATS VIA LEVELS ARE CALCULATED, I WILL TRY TO FIX THIS WHEN I LEARN MORE ABOUT JAVASCRIPT/THINK OF A BETTER WAY 
TO CALCULATE STATS, the calculations might have a bunch of 0 in the decimals part of the answer then have a number but you can just round
that down and the results should be accurate.

As i learn more about javascript there will probably be more updates/different features i add so it might not end up being just a Pet stats
calculator but it is for now.
Also theres parts of version 1.0 where you have to edit the code a little bit but it'll be explained to you when looking at 1.0

Theres 2 different ways you can use this code/script/whatever that i know of.

Way 1: Copy all the code and open inspect element, (Ctrl+Shift+I) click console in the top then paste the code into the bottom and hit
enter, it should progress from there.

Way 2: Copy the code and go to this website (https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/services/javascript-notepad/) paste it into the 
"Your Input" section then click "test code", it should progress from there.
